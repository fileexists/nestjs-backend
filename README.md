<p align="center">A secure, scalable authentication backend built with <strong>NestJS</strong> and <strong>TypeORM</strong>.</p>

## üîê NestJS Backend
Features:

- ‚úÖ JWT authentication
- üîÅ Refresh token rotation
- üõ°Ô∏è Role-based and permission-based access control
- üîí OAuth2 login with Google
- üß† Custom decorators for permission logic
- üìÅ MySQL support with TypeORM

Perfect as a plug-and-play backend for your modern web apps.

### üì¶ Stack
- **NestJS**
- **TypeORM**
- **JWT & Passport**
- **MySQL**
- **Google OAuth2**
- **Role & Permission decorators**

## Project setup
### üìö Install the dependencies
```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ npm install
```
### üìÑ Create your .env
```bash
# Then copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
$ cp .env.sample .env
```
### üîß Google OAuth2 Setup
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. In the top bar, click the **Project selector** and create a new project (or select an existing one).
3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen**:
   - Select the **External** user type.
   - Fill in the **App name**, **User support email**, and **Developer contact info**.
   - Click **Save and Continue** (you can skip scopes for now).
4. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**:
   - Click **+ Create Credentials** ‚Üí **OAuth client ID**.
   - Select **Web application**.
   - Set a name, e.g., **NestJS Auth Backend**.
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add your backend redirect URL:
     ```bash
     # (replace with your production URL if deploying)
     http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback
     ```
   - Click **Create**.
5. After creating the OAuth client:
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
   - Add them to your `.env` file:
     ```bash
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback
     ```
### üÜï Create default User and Permissions
To create the default permissions (which are defined in the `scripts/permission.seed.ts`) and a user with email, password and permission:
```bash
# In case you dont need a user you can run the command without passing the parameters
# If you want you can pass multiple permissions like --permission ADMIN,USER
npx ts-node scripts/init.ts --email admin@example.com --password mySecurePassword --permission ADMIN
```
> [!WARNING]
> If you change the `USER` permission in the `scripts/permission.seed.ts` make sure to change it in the `auth.controller.ts` too.

## Compile and run the project
```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

# How It Works
## Decorators
### üîë `@Permissions()`
The **@Permissions()** decorator is used to restrict access to specific routes based on the user's permissions.
It supports:
* AND logic
* OR logic
* Combined logic
* Wildcard matching

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The permissions are automatically converted to **UPPERCASE** during validation. So even if you write them in lowercase in the decorator, it will still work.

#### ‚ûï AND Logic
`@Permissions('permission1', 'permission2')`
> [!NOTE]
> Requires both **PERMISSION1** and **PERMISSION2**.

#### üîÅ OR Logic
`@Permissions(['permission1', 'permission2'])`
> [!NOTE]
> Requires at least one between **PERMISSION1** and **PERMISSION2**.

#### üîÄ Combined (OR + AND)
`@Permissions(['permission1', 'permission2'], 'permission3')`
> [!NOTE]
> Requires: (**PERMISSION1** OR **PERMISSION2**) AND **PERMISSION3**.

#### üåü Wildcard Matching
`@Permissions('permission_*')`
> [!NOTE]
> Matches any permission starting with **PERMISSION_**. For example: **PERMISSION_VIEW**, **PERMISSION_EDIT**, **PERMISSION_ADMIN**, etc.

### `üåê Public()`
There may be cases where you want certain routes or controllers to be publicly accessible (without requiring authentication).\ 
In such cases, you can use the **@Public()** decorator to skip the AuthGuard for specific endpoints or controllers.
Example:
```javascript
@Controller('auth')
@Public()
export class AuthController { } 
```
---
## üõ°Ô∏è Guards
### üîí AuthGuard
> Handles user authentication using JWT tokens.

#### What it does:
* Protects routes by default (unless explicitly marked as public).
* Checks for a valid access_token in:
  * Authorization header (Bearer ...)
  * or cookies (access_token)
* If the access_token is missing or expired, and a refresh_token is available:
  * ‚úÖ It will automatically use the refresh_token to generate new tokens and save them in cookies.
  * ‚ùå If both tokens are invalid or missing, the request is rejected with **401 Unauthorized**.

#### Public routes:
As stated before you can make a route public by using the **@Public()** decorator.
### üîê PermissionsGuard
> Handles authorization: checks if the authenticated user has the required permissions to access a route.

#### What it does:
* Reads the required permissions defined on a route using a **@Permissions()** decorator.
* Gets the authenticated user's permissions from the database.
* Compares the user‚Äôs permissions with the required ones:
  * ‚úÖ If the user has all required permissions, access is allowed.
  * ‚ùå If not, access is denied with a 403 Forbidden.

#### Advanced features:
‚úÖ Supports wildcard matching (e.g. USER.*)\
üî† Case-insensitive
